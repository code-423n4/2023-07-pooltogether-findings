## [NC-01] Update `_claimer` only for non-zero value
During `Vault` deployment, Address of `Claimer` contract can be set with `_setClaimer` function which called internally in the constructor. 

It is commented that the passed param:
> *// @dev claimer_ can be set to address zero if none is available yet.*

So if deployer decide it to change later for above reason, s/he still would able to call `_setClaimer` function passing zero address by default in the constructor. Hence, updating the storage slot of Vault contract unnecessary. 

NOTE: Even though it re-initialized with zero address, it still cost gas of amount of updating storage slot.  

### Proof of Concept

https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L242

### Recommendation
Remove `_setClaimer` from constructor, as it can be changed later with setter function. 
or 

Add this check in the `Vault#constructor()` to avoid initializing the storage slot with default value.
```solidity
if (claimer_ != address(0)) 
	_setClaimer(claimer_); 
```


## [NC-02] Typo in natspec of `ObservationLib.sol`

*File: ObservationLib.sol*
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Sets max ring buffer length in the Account.observations Observation list.
 *         As users transfer/mint/burn tickets new Observation checkpoints are recorded.
 *         The current `MAX_CARDINALITY` guarantees a one year minimum, of accurate historical lookups.
 * @dev The user Account.Account.cardinality parameter can NOT exceed the max cardinality variable.
 *      Preventing "corrupted" ring buffer lookup pointers and new observation checkpoints.
 */
uint16 constant MAX_CARDINALITY = 365; // 1 year

```

Typo in above natspec, it should be *"The current MAX_CARDINALITY guarantees a one year **maxium**, of accurate historical lookups."*

As after completing 365 checkpoints, its start overwriting previous observation, also explained in above natspec.

## Recommendation
change minimum -> maximum
