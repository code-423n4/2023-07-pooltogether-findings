                      ABOUT THE PROTOCOL

     PoolTogether is a no-loss prize saving protocol that is used to save deposits that generate yields over time. this yield is awarded periodically as random prizes to users of the protocol. The protocol is a layer that can be added to any yield-bearing asset. 
    With the introduction of V5, the protocol has become fully autonomous as it has no admin controls. It is also fully automated amd permissionless as any one can create new vaults to add yield sources to the protocol.
                 CORE FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE PROTOCOL

     1.   DEPOSIT: Allows users to depossit their assets, and shares are minted to them 
          according to the amount of their deposit.
     2.   LIQUIDATE: Allows the liquidation of users' assets and shares are on the other 
          hand, is minted to them
     3.   REDEEM: Allows users to redeem their assets from the protocol.
     4    WITHDRAW: This allows users to burn their shares to recieve their assets 
          equivalent 
     5    SPONSOOR: Allows one to sponsor another by depositing an amount of assets and 
          shares are minted to the sponsorship address(receiver). It also aloows sponsoring and depositing with permit.
     
                 APPROACH/LESSONS LEARNT DURING THE AUDITING PROCESS

     I tried as much as possible to understand the codebase well so as to figure out any unexpected behaviour and I also made sure to checkout how funds enter and leave the protocol.
     Having audited the protocol, I learnt more how the time weighted average average balance works and also deepened my understanding of solidity and smart contracts in general.
