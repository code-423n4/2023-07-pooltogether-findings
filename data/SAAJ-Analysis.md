# Approach
My approach towards auditing PoolTogether is first going through code walkthrough video in order to understand major concept of the project. Then i go through official documents and flow diagram to gain more insight of project working. 
Then i go for gas and QA firstly to have more time for high and medium issues. I was successful in finding a medium issue after going through code line by line and marking issues that seems to be of interest. The issues i identified is then search for different audit reports to have more clear insight which help me getting clear idea about the attack vector.

# Learning
The learning from this project is related to go through previous audit reports to look for understanding issue that is of similar in nature. This helps me in identifying and reporting issue with better clarification.
# Comments
My single medium finding related to this project is based on abusing of balance method to cause loss of funds in the vault which may damage the whole project.
