# PoolTogether Analysis Report

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- Started with the docs
- Then the codes in scope line by line
- Took a brief look at other contracts not in scope
- Back to the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
- Went through the discord chats to deeply understand sponsors choice of design and also try to understand it's risks, i.e if I can recommend a better method to implement the strategies.
- Unfortunately didn't have enough time to discuss design ideas with protocol team due to time restraints since I started the contest late
- Finally then back to the codebase to sum up my reports/findings

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase

Multiple things, to list a few:

- Tiers and the complex algorithm used in them in Pooltogether
- How a prize saving protocol is expected to work
- Yield bearing/Prize-wrapped assets (would probably have to spend more time to really get this)

### Refresher on previously acquainted things

Got a deeper understanding of formerly acquainted topics like:

- Implementing the dutch auction method in solidity
- A few other basic solidity concepts

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

This is an update contest, so I approached it first as a learning opportunity, though the somewhat complex math used slowed my whole review of the contracts and unfortunately I could not spend as much focused time as I would have liked on the contest, but I believe, I've submitted issues I think should be looked on, I spent around 22 - 25 hours (_was distracted multiple times, so real time might be way lesser than this say ~17-20_) hours spread around 3/4 days on the contest.â€¨


### Time spent:
24 hours
