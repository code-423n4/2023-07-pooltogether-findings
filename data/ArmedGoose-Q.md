1. [Low] silent overflow in https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L1154-L1155
The function explicitly casts uint256 to uint96, which may cause a silent overflow and return an unexpected value.

```
  function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _shares) internal virtual override {
    _twabController.transfer(_from, _to, uint96(_shares)); //@audit slient overflow

    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _shares);
  }
```
It is recommended to use the same value size or a safeCast library.

2. [Low] Lack of equal array check - in https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L618C1-L619 there is iteration over `_winners` array and in next line its length is used to indicate current index of `_prizeIndices`. The problem is there is no check if these arrays have equal length and it may lead to an unexpected behavior or a rever if winners is of different length.
Recommendation: Check if length of `_winners` is equal to length of `_prizeIndices`.

3. [Info] redundant code in https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L408 - will not happen since `maxDeposit` = always `(uint256).max` in `ERC4626.sol`;
